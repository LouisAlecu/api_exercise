# FCA-API
You are required to build the backend of a web app that handles book loans for a small local library. As part
of the exercise, you will need to setup and populate a database and create an API that meets the criteria
outlined below. The API needs to be built using Python with SQLite used for the database.
You have been provided with a CSV file containing the initial book inventory data and should design the
table structure as you see appropriate.

The API requires endpoints that allow the library staff to perform the following operations:


1. For Library Website Users:
	a. An endpoint that allows the database searching by title and by author, returning books and
their availability.
	b. Add/remove unavailable books to/from a wishlist such that they are notified when they
become available


2. For Library Staff:
	c. Change the rental status (available/borrowed) for a book (which should also trigger the email
notifications to users with the book in their wishlist)
	d. Generate a report on the number of books being rented and how many days theyâ€™ve been
rented for.
	e. The frontend of the library website displays affiliate links to copies of the book available on
Amazon for each book. The Amazon book IDs can be retrieved from the OpenLibrary API
(no developer key required). An endpoint is required that will update the Amazon IDs stored
in the database for all the books.

The function in endpoint (c) that requires emails to be sent out should be implemented by printing the email
text to the output or logging to a file.
